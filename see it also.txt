some new ideas to make project mine 
1) give life lines like 5 life lives when game over revert back game to last 5th position or Power-Ups: You could add power-ups to the game that give players an advantage. For example, a power-up that allows players to combine tiles diagonally instead of just horizontally and vertically, or a power-up that clears the board of all tiles except the highest-value one.
2) along with best score also add feature like time taken . avergarge time per moves, no. of moves 
3)leaderborad
4)background music and effects 
6)Undo Move: Add the ability for players to undo their last move. This would allow them to correct mistakes and make the game less frustrating.
